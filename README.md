# Hey! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ I'm Esteban

## CS Student | Full-Stack Dev | Data Enthusiast

Building cool stuff with clean code at Universidad de Costa Rica. Currently turning coffee into enterprise applications ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### What I'm Up To (ง •̀_•́)ง
- **ThemePark@UCR**: Making campus tours less boring with VR ┬┴┬┴┤(･_├┬┴┬┴
- **METICS**: Teaching professors how to use technology (plot twist: they're great at it!)
- **TA Life**: Explaining why `print("Hello World")` isn't the solution to everything ಠ_ಠ

### Cool Projects ಠ╭╮ಠ

**ThemePark@UCR**  
*Web & VR platform that makes campus exploration actually fun*
- Clean Architecture because messy code makes me sad (╥﹏╥)
- Azure AD B2C + JWT (enterprise security that actually works) (⌐■_■)
- 80%+ test coverage (I test my tests) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**Rocket Landing Optimizer**  
*Teaching rockets how to land without exploding*
- 3 algorithms: brute force, heuristic, and "please work" metaheuristic (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
- Kerbal Space Program integration (for science!) ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ

**Minecraft Server Analysis**  
*Proving that more RAM doesn't always = better performance*
- Statistical analysis with Python (pandas go brrr) (｡◕‿◕｡)
- Applied fancy statistics to justify playing Minecraft ლ(╹◡╹ლ)

### My Arsenal ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

```
Languages: C# • Python • SQL • JavaScript
Web Stuff: .NET 8.0 • ASP.NET Core • Blazor 
Cloud: Azure AD B2C • JWT • Azure VM
Data: Pandas • SciPy • "Why is my plot sideways?"
Tools: Visual Studio • Git • xUnit • Coffee
```

### Flex Zone (▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)
- Academic Excellence Scholarship (9.0+ GPA because why not) (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
- TA who actually explains OOP without crying ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
- Successfully deployed to Azure (first try was... eventful) (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
- AI regulation expert (ChatGPT is not your homework buddy) (ᵔᴥᵔ)

### GitHub Stats
![Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=YOUR_USERNAME&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

### Currently Learning (oﾟvﾟ)ノ
- How to explain Clean Architecture without drawing 47 diagrams
- Advanced ways to make databases cry less ಥ_ಥ
- VR development (motion sickness included) @_@

### Let's Chat! (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ
- ebairesdev@gmail.com
- San José, Costa Rica
- Fluent in Spanish, English, and Stack Overflow ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

*"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad." - But I'll explain it anyway* ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
